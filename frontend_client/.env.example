# CRA development server host configuration
# Set these only for local development when you access the app via:
# - a tunnel (ngrok/cloudflared)
# - a custom domain
# - a container/VM with port-forwarding
#
# HOST defines which network interface the dev server binds to.
# 0.0.0.0 allows external access (e.g., from tunnels or container port mapping).

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set this in production.
